# Knowledge-Representation-and-Reasoning
CSE 579 - KRR

Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is one of the fundamental areas in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. It is concerned with how knowledge can be represented in formal languages and manipulated in an automated way so that computers can make intelligent decisions based on the encoded knowledge. KRR techniques are key drivers of innovation in computer science, and they have led to signiﬁcant advances in practical applications in a wide range of areas from Artiﬁcial Intelligence to Software Engineering. In recent years, KRR has also derived challenges from new and emerging ﬁelds including the semantic web, computational biology, and the development of software agents.

This repo consists of all the projects that I worked on for the completion of the CSE 579: Knowledge Representataion and Reasoning Course at ASU.

**Programming Assignments -**
1. _**Simple Answer Set Programming**_ : A set of 9 problems including the most difficult sudoku problem, many variations of the classic sudoku problem, Schur Numbers, chessboard puzzles.
2. **_Blocks World Scenario Sroblems_**

**Course Project-**
1. **_Milestone 1_** - Solution to Introductory Clingo Program

Milestone 1 focussed on gaining familiarity with clingo, a robust tool for running answer set programs on my own machine. I followed three specific steps as outlined in the submission prompts to effectively start using clingo.
   Step 1 - Installation and Setup of Clingo.
   Step 2 - Running a test program to check the installation.
   Step 3 - Finding stable models for a given clingo program.
   
2. **_Milestone 2_** - Solutions to Basic Clingo Problems 

In this milestone, I utilized Clingo to determine the stable models for three basic ASP (Answer Set Programming) programs.

3. **_Milestone 3_** - Individual Progress Report


This milestone introduced the _Insurance Referee Assignment Problem_. I familiarized myself with the problem statement by thoroughly reviewing the project documentation and conducting additional research on ASP and Clingo through official documentation. The milestone required the submission of a project progress report in the AAAI format The report includes several key sections:
  Problem statement
  Progress made
  Issues encountered
  Tasks Remaining

4. **_Milestone 4_** - Project Report

This milestone required the submission of the final project report and the code necessary to solve the Insurance Referee Assignment problem. The code successfully addressed all the hard and weak constraints outlined in the problem statement.
