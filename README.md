# Knowledge-Representation-and-Reasoning
CSE 579 - KRR

Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) is one of the fundamental areas in Artiﬁcial Intelligence. It is concerned with how knowledge can be represented in formal languages and manipulated in an automated way so that computers can make intelligent decisions based on the encoded knowledge. KRR techniques are key drivers of innovation in computer science, and they have led to signiﬁcant advances in practical applications in a wide range of areas from Artiﬁcial Intelligence to Software Engineering. In recent years, KRR has also derived challenges from new and emerging ﬁelds including the semantic web, computational biology, and the development of software agents.

This repo consists all the projects that I worked on for the completion of the Knowledge Representataion and Reasoning Course at ASU.
